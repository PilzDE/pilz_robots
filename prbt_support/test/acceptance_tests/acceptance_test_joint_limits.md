# Acceptance Test Joint Limits using the real robot

## Prerequisites
  - Properly connect and startup the robot. Make sure an emergency stop is within reach.
  - Note that the robot will try to move exactly to the limits of each joint. Make sure that collisions are avoided or
    skip the test for certain joints.

## Starting the joint limit acceptance tests
  - Press the enabling switch and run `roslaunch prbt_support robot.launch`.
  - Run `rosrun prbt_support acceptance_test_joint_limits.py`.
  - Please note: Each test must be confirmed before it is executed. Confirm by entering `y` or `n` to skip test.

## Test descriptions
  - The concrete test descriptions consisting of test-summary, test-sequence and expected results can be found in
    `acceptance_test_joint_limits.py`.
