# Acceptance Test Acceleration Limit using the real robot

## Prerequisites
  - Properly connect and startup the robot and power cabinet containing the PSS4000.
  - Make sure an emergency stop is within reach.
  - **Be careful, the robot might crash into the table.**

### Test Sequence

  1. Press the acknowledge button. Make sure the green light on the robot is on and switch into T1 mode (if not active yet). Run
  ```
  roslaunch prbt_moveit_config moveit_planning_execution.launch sim:=False pipeline:=pilz_industrial_motion_planner
  ```
  and execute
  ```
  rosrun pilz_control acceptance_test_acceleration_limit.py
  ```
  2. Switch into AUTO mode. Make sure the drives are enabled again by pressing RESET and execute
  ```
  rosrun pilz_control acceptance_test_acceleration_limit.py
  ```
  3. Use RViz to plan a movement with velocity- and acceleration scaling 1.0. Check if it can be planned successfully. Execute it.

### Expected Results
  1. All tests pass
  2. All tests pass
  3. Movement is executed without errors.

## Running the Test Without Real Hardware

  This can be useful but is not sufficient for the acceptance of the feature. The `robot_mock` that is used here does not represent the PRBT in any way. Simply replace the `roslaunch`-command by
  ```
  roslaunch pilz_control robot_mock.launch
  ```
  and proceed as described above. In order to simulate switching into AUTO mode, you can call
  ```
  rosservice call /controller_ns/test_joint_trajectory_controller/monitor_cartesian_speed "data: false"
  ```
