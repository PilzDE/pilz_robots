# Acceptance Test Speed Monitoring using the real robot

## Prerequisites
  - Properly connect and startup the robot and power cabinet containing the PSS4000.
  - Make sure an emergency stop is within reach.

## Start in T1 mode

### Test Sequence

  1. Press the acknowledge button. Make sure the green light on the robot is on and switch into T1 mode (if not active yet). Run
  ```
  roslaunch prbt_moveit_config moveit_planning_execution.launch sim:=False pipeline:=pilz_industrial_motion_planner
  ```
  and
  ```
  roslaunch pilz_control joint_states_speed_observer.launch
  ```
  2. Execute `rosrun pilz_control acceptance_test_speed_monitoring.py`.
  3. Perform movements via RViz with velocity scales `0.1` and `1.0`.
  4. Switch into AUTO mode. Make sure the drives are enabled again by pressing RESET and execute `rosrun pilz_control acceptance_test_speed_monitoring.py auto`.
  5. Perform movements via RViz with velocity scale `1.0`.
  6. Switch back into T1 mode. Make sure the drives are enabled again by pressing the acknowledge button and execute `rosrun pilz_control acceptance_test_speed_monitoring.py`.
  7. Perform movements via RViz with velocity scales `0.1` and `1.0`.

### Expected Results
  1. The robot starts properly and is moveable via Rviz.
  2. All tests pass.
  3. A movement with velocity scale of `1.0` should be interrupted by a stop. The maxmimum frame speed should **not** have exceeded the limit of `0.25m/s`.
  4. All tests pass.
  5. The robot movements should **not** have been interrupted. The maximum frame speed should have exceeded the limit of `0.25m/s`. 
  6. All tests pass.
  7. A movement with velocity scale of `1.0` should be interrupted by a stop. The maxmimum frame speed should **not** have exceeded the limit of `0.25m/s`.

## Running the Test Without Real Hardware

  This can be useful but is not sufficient for the acceptance of the feature. The `robot_mock` that is used here does not represent the PRBT in any way. Simply replace the `roslaunch`-commands by
  ```
  roslaunch pilz_control robot_mock.launch
  ```
  and
  ```
  roslaunch pilz_control joint_states_speed_observer.launch robot_name:=robot_mock
  ```
  Then proceed as described above. In order to simulate switching into AUTO mode, you can call
  ```
  rosservice call /controller_ns/test_joint_trajectory_controller/monitor_cartesian_speed "data: false"
  ```
