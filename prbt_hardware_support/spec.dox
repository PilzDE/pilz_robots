 *  @section system_specification System Specification
 *  @brief System Specification
 *
 *  @subsection ISO-10218-1
 *
 *
 *
 * @subsubsection sto_stop1 Safe torque off (STO) and  Stop 1
 *
 * @note STO == 1/TRUE  <-> robot is allowed to move freely
 * @note STO == 0/FALSE <-> robot is NOT allowed to move (except for stop motion)
 *
 * @definereq{Stop1_Trigger}
 *  - A Stop 1 is triggered, if at least one of the following cases is true:
 *    - the state of the STO changes from TRUE -> FALSE,
 *    - connection to safety controller is lost,
 *    - the messages informing about the STO (coming from the
 *      safety controller) is incomplete or in any way corrupted,
 *    - the communication protocol used by the safety controller
 *      does not fulfill the expected specification
 *      (defined by the version of the protocol).
 *
 * @definereq{No_new_commands_during_STO_false}
 *  - As long as the STO is FALSE, no new motions commands are allowed.
 *
 * @definereq{Hold_driver_if_STO_false}
 *  - If the STO changes from TRUE -> FALSE the driver is halted.
 *
 * @definereq{Recover_driver_after_STO_false}
 *  - If the STO changes from FALSE -> TRUE, the driver is recovered.
 *
 *
 * @definereq{No_Startup_if_controller_hold_missing}
 *  - The system is not allowed to complete the startup procedure until
 *    the controller hold service is available.
 *
 * @definereq{No_Startup_if_driver_halt_missing}
 *  - The system is not allowed to complete the startup procedure until
 *    the driver halt service is available.
 *
 * @definereq{Controller_service_unhold_optional}
 *  - The system can still be started even if the controller unhold service
 *    is missing.
 *
 * @definereq{Driver_service_recover_optional}
 *  - The system can still be started even if the driver recover service
 *    is missing.
 *
 *
 *
 * @subsubsection brake_test Braketest
 *
 * @definereq{Is_BrakeTest_required_mechanism}
 *  - The system provides a mechanism which allows to determine if
 *    a braketest is requested by the safety controller.
 *
 *  - The mechanism continues to return the last received value,
 *    if at least one of the following conditions is true:
 *    - the connection to the safety controller is lost,
 *    - the messages informing about the operation mode (coming from the
 *      safety controller) is incomplete or in any way corrupted,
 *    - the communication protocol used by the safety controller
 *      does not fulfill the expected specification
 *      (defined by the version of the protocol).
 *
 * @definereq{Execute_BrakeTest_mechanism}
 * - The system provides a mechanism which allows to execute a brake test.
 * - The brake test is performed for all axes.
 * - The brake test mechanism returns a status stating if the
 *    brake test was successful xor what error occured.
 * - At the beginning of the brake test it is checked if the robot is
 *    currently moving. In case the robot is moving, the brake test is not
 *    performed and an error is retured.
 * - As long as the brake test is performed no motion is allowed. Commands
 *    send during the execution of the brake test are rejected.
 * - Brake tests are only performed for drives which define that they require
 *    a brake test (configurable via config file or parameter server).
 * - After the brake test is performed the result of the brake test is
 *    reported back to the safety controller. The result is also reported back
 *    to the safety controller if the brake test was not required by the
 *    safety controller.
 * - If the connection to the safety controller is lost, no further
 *    action regarding the sending of the brake test result is taken (e.g. NO
 *    result sending as soon as the connection is established again).
 *
 *
 *
 * @subsubsection operation_mode Operation Mode
 *
 * @definereq{Get_OperationMode_mechanism}
 *  - The system provides a mechanism which allows to request the current
 *    operation mode of the safety controller.
 *
 *  - The mechanism to request the operation mode returns UNKNOWN,
 *    if at least one of the following cases comes true:
 *    - the connection to the safety controller is lost,
 *    - the messages informing about the operation mode (coming from the
 *      safety controller) is incomplete or in any way corrupted,
 *    - the communication protocol used by the safety controller
 *      does not fulfill the expected specification
 *      (defined by the version of the protocol).
