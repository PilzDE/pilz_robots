# Acceptance Test for the braketest feature
These acceptance tests check that the real robot system reacts to a BrakeTest service call properly.

## Prerequisites
  - Properly connect and startup the robot and power cabinet containing the PSS4000.
    Make sure an emergency stop is within reach.

### Test Sequence
  1. Press the acknowledge button. Make sure the green light on the power cabinet is on.
  Run `roslaunch prbt_moveit_config moveit_planning_execution.launch sim:=False pipeline:=pilz_command_planner sto:=pss4000 has_braketest_support:=true gripper:=pg70`
  2. Run `rosservice call /prbt/brake_test_required`
  3. Run `rosservice call /prbt/execute_braketest`
  4. Try to perform a robot motion via Rviz during the braketest execution
  5. Perform a long robot motion via Rviz and run `rosservice call /prbt/execute_braketest`
  6. Run `rosservice call /prbt/brake_test_required`
### Expected Results
  1. The robot starts properly and is moveable via Rviz.
  2. A Service returns True
  3. The brake test is executed for all joints (Multiple *clicks* should be audible).
     The service responds with correct result code (for more information run `rosmsg show BrakeTestErrorCodes`).
  4. No robot motion is executed.
  5. No brake test is executed. The service responds with correct result code and a descriptive error message.
  6. A Service returns False
