# PILZ robot manipulator module PRBT 6 in ROS

## Package: pilz_robots
The meta package for the PILZ manipulator PRBT 6. Here you can find documentation of the individual packages. For a general overview and link collection we refer to the [wiki page](http://wiki.ros.org/pilz_robots).

### Installation
To use the packages, you can install prebuilt packages with
```
sudo apt install ros-kinetic-pilz-robots
or
sudo apt install ros-melodic-pilz-robots
```

## Package: prbt_support
The package contains the robot description of the PRBT manipulator.
- `urdf/` contains the xacros for generating the urdf descriptions of the PILZ robot PRBT.
- `meshes/` contains the stl files for visualization
- `test/` contains test files for urdf
  - build tests: `catkin_make tests`
  - build and run tests: `catkin_make run_tests`
- `config/` defines the controllers and drivers. Loads the specialized `PilzTrajectoryController`.

### Pilz Coordinate Frames
To see the robot in rviz you can use
``roslaunch prbt_support test_urdf.launch``

The joint directions are illustrated in the following image:
![Joints](prbt_support/img/joints.png)

### Configure the tcp
You can easily adjust the tool center point frame with an offset and rotation in the xacro file.

1. Open prbt_support/urdf/prbt.xacro
2. Edit the lines to your desired offset

```
  <xacro:unless value="$(arg gripper)">
    <xacro:arg name="tcp_offset_xyz" default="0 0 0"/>
    <xacro:arg name="tcp_offset_rpy" default="0 0 0"/>
  </xacro:unless>
```

Note: You can set a different default if you have a gripper attached.

## Package: prbt\_moveit\_config
The package is generated by moveit setup assistant. It contains configuration files and launch files needed
to start up the robot including planning and execution.

### Configuring the robot
Use the launch file `moveit_planning_execution.launch` to bringup the robot controllers
with the complete moveit pipeline.
The launch file allows to set optional parameters
* `sim` (default: True) <br>
    true: Use fake execution and display emulated robot position in RViz<br>
    false: connect to real robot using `ros_canopen`
* `pipeline` (default: ompl) <br>
    Planning pipeline to use with moveit
* `load_robot_description` (default: True)<br>
    Load robot description to parameter server. Can be set to false to let someone else load the model
* `rviz_config` (default: prbt_moveit_config/launch/moveit.rviz)<br>
    Start RViz with default configuration settings. Once you have changed the configuration and have saved
       it inside your package folder, set the path and file name here.
* `gripper` (default: None) <br>
    See [Running the prbt with a gripper](#running-the-prbt-with-a-gripper)
* `sto` (default: pnoz)<br>
    Connect to the safety controller that handles the safe-torque-off signal. 
	Only relevant for `sim:=False` to issue a Safe stop 1.
	See [prbt_hardware_support package](prbt_hardware_support/README.md).

### Running the simulation
1. Run `roslaunch prbt_moveit_config moveit_planning_execution.launch sim:=true pipeline:=ompl`
2. Use the moveit Motion Planning rviz plugin to plan and execute
   (see e.g. [ROS-I training exercise 3.4](http://ros-industrial.github.io/industrial_training/_source/session3/Motion-Planning-RVIZ.html))

### Running on the real robot
1. Bringup can: `sudo ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 1000000` (after every reboot or reconnect of the CAN hardware).
   For persistent configuration append the following to the file `/etc/network/interfaces`

```
auto can0
iface can0 can static
        bitrate 1000000
```

2. Run `roslaunch prbt_moveit_config moveit_planning_execution.launch sim:=false pipeline:=ompl`
3. Use the moveit Motion Planning rviz plugin to plan and execute (see simulation section; set `Velocity Scaling` to 0.1 first)

Instead of OMPL use the motion planners of Pilz for executing industrial robot commands like PTP, LIN, etc. For this install the
package [pilz_trajectory_generation](http://wiki.ros.org/pilz_trajectory_generation):
```
sudo apt install ros-kinetic-pilz-trajectory-generation
or
sudo apt install ros-melodic-pilz-trajectory-generation
```

then replace the pipeline in the above command by `pipeline:=pilz_command_planner`.

### Adjust expert paramters
If you've created an application package with your own launch file as described in the
[tutorials](https://wiki.ros.org/pilz_robots/Tutorials/ModelYourApplicationWithPRBT#Create_your_application_ROS_package),
you can easily adjust many other configuration parameters.
See the template and comments in the [pilz_tutorials package](https://github.com/PilzDE/pilz_tutorials).

### Running the prbt with a gripper
Currently only the Schunk pg70 is supported. To run it, first install the package:
```
sudo apt install ros-kinetic-prbt-pg70-support
or
sudo apt install ros-melodic-prbt-pg70-support
```

then start the robot like before but with the `gripper:=pg70` set. Both simulation and real robot work.

## Package: prbt_ikfast_manipulator_plugin
The package contains a moveit plugin for inverse kinematics of the manipulator, which is a
wrapper of `ikfast.cpp` to the kinematics base interface of moveit.

## Package: pilz_control
Contains a specialized version of `ros_controllers::JointTrajectoryController` which can be put into a holding mode.
A controlled stop using a hold trajectory is performed thus stopping the manipulator without the mechanical stress of a hard brake.

## Package: prbt_hardware_support
This package provides support for the Pilz hardware PNOZmulti and realizes the Stop1 functionality. A configurable modbus connection is set up via `roslaunch prbt_hardware_support modbus_read_client.launch`.

## Package: prbt_gazebo
Provides a launch file to run the prbt manipulator inside gazebo.
