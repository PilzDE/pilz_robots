# PILZ robot manipulator module PRBT 6 in ROS

## Package: pilz_robots
The meta package for the PILZ manipulator PRBT 6. Here you can find documentation of the individual packages. For a general overview and link collection we refer to the [wiki page](http://wiki.ros.org/pilz_robots).

## Package: prbt_support
The package contains the robot description of the PRBT manipulator.
- `urdf/` contains the xacros for generating the urdf descriptions of the PILZ robot PRBT.
- `meshes/` contains the stl files for visualization
- `test/` contains test files for urdf
  - build tests: `catkin_make tests`
  - build and run tests: `catkin_make run_tests`
- `config/` defines the controllers and drivers. Loads the specialized `PilzTrajectoryController`.

### Pilz Coordinate Frames
To see the robot in rviz you can use
``roslaunch prbt_support test_urdf.launch``

The joint directions are illustrated in the following image:
![Joints](prbt_support/img/joints.png)

### Configure the tcp
You can easily adjust the tool center point frame with an offset and rotation in the xacro file.

1. Open prbt_support/urdf/prbt.xacro
2. Edit the lines to your desired offset

```
  <xacro:unless value="$(arg gripper)">
    <xacro:arg name="tcp_offset_xyz" default="0 0 0"/>
    <xacro:arg name="tcp_offset_rpy" default="0 0 0"/>
  </xacro:unless>
```

Note: You can set a different default if you have a gripper attached.

## Package: prbt\_moveit\_config
The package is generated by moveit setup assistant. It contains configuration files and launch files needed
to start up the robot including planning and execution.

![PRBT with MotionPlanningPlugin in rviz](prbt_moveit_config/img/prbt_rviz_planning_screenshot.png)

### Configuring the robot
Use the launch file `moveit_planning_execution.launch` to bringup the robot controllers
with the complete moveit pipeline.
The launch file allows to set optional parameters
* `sim` (default: True) <br>
    true: Use fake execution and display emulated robot position in RViz<br>
    false: connect to real robot using `ros_canopen`
* `pipeline` (default: ompl) <br>
    Planning pipeline to use with moveit
* `gripper` (default: None) <br>
    See [Running the prbt with a gripper](#running-the-prbt-with-a-gripper)

### Running the simulation
1. Run `roslaunch prbt_moveit_config moveit_planning_execution.launch sim:=true pipeline:=ompl`
2. Use the moveit Motion Planning rviz plugin to plan and execute
   (see e.g. [ROS-I training exercise 3.4](http://ros-industrial.github.io/industrial_training/_source/session3/Motion-Planning-RVIZ.html))

### Running on the real robot
1. Bringup can: `sudo ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 1000000` (after every reboot or reconnect of the CAN hardware).
   For persistent configuration append the following to the file `/etc/network/interfaces`

```
auto can0
iface can0 can static
        bitrate 1000000
```

2. Run `roslaunch prbt_moveit_config moveit_planning_execution.launch sim:=false pipeline:=ompl`
3. Use the moveit Motion Planning rviz plugin to plan and execute (see simulation section; set `Velocity Scaling` to 0.1 first)

Instead of OMPL use the motion planners of Pilz for executing industrial robot commands like PTP, LIN, etc. For this install the
package [pilz_trajectory_generation](http://wiki.ros.org/pilz_trajectory_generation):
* `sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-pilz-trajectory-generation`

then replace the pipeline in the above command by `pipeline:=command_planner`.

### Running the prbt with a gripper
Currently only the Schunk pg70 is supported. To run it, first install the package:
* `sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-prbt-pg70-support`

then start the robot like before but with the `gripper:=pg70` set. Both simulation and real robot work.

## Package: prbt_ikfast_manipulator_plugin
The package contains a moveit plugin for inverse kinematics of the manipulator, which is a
wrapper of `ikfast.cpp` to the kinematics base interface of moveit.

## Package: pilz_control
Contains a specialized version of `ros_controllers::JointTrajectoryController` which can be put into a holding mode.
A controlled stop using a hold trajectory is performed thus stopping the manipulator without the mechanical stress of a hard brake.

## Package: prbt_hardware_support
This package provides support for the Pilz hardware PNOZmulti and realizes the Stop1 functionality. A configurable modbus connection is set up via `roslaunch prbt_hardware_support modbus_read_client.launch`.

## Package: prbt_gazebo
Provides a launch file to run the prbt manipulator inside gazebo.
